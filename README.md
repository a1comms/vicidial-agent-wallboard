Vicidial/GoAutoDial Agent Wallboard

HTML5 Drag-and-Drop Agent Status Wallboard for ViciDial and GoAutoDial.

Designed to be displayed on the contact centre so managers and agents can at a glance see that status of all other agents and calls queuing.

Go to wallboard.php?edit=true to enter edit mode, add/remove your SIP phones from the display, drag them into your seating plan and save.

Return to wallboard.php and the status of the agents and call queues will update automatically, once per second.
